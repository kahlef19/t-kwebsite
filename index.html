<h2>Welcome to T&K Creations!</h2>
	<p> We’re just two humble humans who started this adventure with a little extra talent, a lot of enthusiasm, and a dash of caffeine. It all began one late night when we decided our blank t-shirts needed a little more personality. After some trial, error, and a few hilarious crafting mishaps, we created our first design, proudly showing it off to family and friends. They loved it so much (or maybe they were just being nice), but before we knew it, people were asking for more. What started as a side hustle quickly blossomed into a family business, filled with creativity, love, and way more vinyl rolls than we ever anticipated. </p>

	<p> Our family plays a huge part in T&K Creations. Our kids are our biggest fans and sometimes our toughest critics! From choosing colors to testing out our creations, they’ve been there every step of the way. Our business grew as they grew, with each of us contributing in our own special ways. Whether it’s me running the designs, our little ones “approving” each product (usually by trying them on), or the occasional family assembly line to meet a deadline, T&K has truly become a family affair. It's a business built on fun, hard work, and countless memories.</p>

	<p> At T&K Creations, we believe in putting a smile on your face with each shirt, hoodie, or custom creation. We strive to be your go-to shop for high-quality designs with heart, humor, and a little edge. Our mission is to offer affordable, custom products while staying true to our values of family, creativity, and joy. We’re grateful to share a piece of our journey with you, one t-shirt at a time, and hope to bring a little extra happiness (and a few laughs) to your wardrobe!</p>

<p>T&K is an outstanding company, customer service that never hesitate to go the extra mile. I cannot recommend T&K highly enough. They really care about giving you exactly what you want, even if doing so may not be easy. I have loved working with them! Their positive, can-do, friendly attitude is so refreshing!	</p>

<p>Kahle was SOOO helpful in designing our club T-shirts; patiently listening to our ideas, offering suggestions, and explaining our options and the whole process. Quality products at a reasonable price!</p>
